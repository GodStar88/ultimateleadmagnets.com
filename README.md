I want you to set up the bestfreebusinesstools.com so that when someone signs up they can only get an affiliate link if they have a code. The code will be generated at a different web site
Anyone can still sign up but only those with a special code will have the affiliate link to be able to collect cell numbers

Begin with bestfreebusinesstools.com for code only affiliate access

I will have a new domain to generate the code on

There customers will sign up to be able to be an affiliate of several web site of mine

But they will have to have a code to do it

So begin with bestfreebusinesstools now

ultimateleadmagnets.com

This is the domain we will set up for a membership site to get the codes for the other sites

User Joins ultimateleadmagnets.com, gets affiliate code, signs up with that code to the other web sites

uses those web sites as a lead magnet

Please add  ultimateleadmagnets.com  to the hosting

That is the domain we will use to generate codes so allow users to become affiliates at the other web sites
