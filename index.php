                    <h3 class="fontcolor" style="margin: auto; margin-top: 50px;">Not long ago I had the same issue. I had a great product and I knew if I could just build a lead magnet that would attract people to sign up to my list and introduce them to what I had to offer I could convert them to buy.</h3>

I tried different ebooks and videos and educational courses and, and, and ….   my conversions were still poor :( </h3>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h1 class="fontcolor" style="margin: auto; margin-top: 50px;">But then I realized something!</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <img src="assets/images/realized.jpg" alt="" width="200px" height="280px" style="margin: auto; margin-top: 50px;">
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h3 class="fontcolor" style="margin: auto; margin-top: 50px;">In order to REALLY build a Lead Magnent that could deliver what I needed I would need to go beyond what other people usually provide. </br></br>
                    I would need to STAND OUT and set myself apart from the common offers that are used as Lead Magnets.</br></br>
                    My idea was to build a full blown system that was SO outstanding it would be a Super No Brainer for my prospects to sign up. Something everyone would want!</br></br>
                    This was the start of ULTIMATE LEAD MAGNETS!</br></br>
                    I built the first Ultimate Lead Magnet to prove the concept and sent traffic to it on a Tuesday morning. I tracked the click to sign up ratio and WOW!</br></br>
                    I knew right then I was on to something :)</br></br>
                    Previosly, my best conversion rate had been 23% from a highly desirable course I had gotten the resell rights to.</br></br>
                    But that Tuesday, I got a conversion rate of 77%!!!</br></br>
                    I had never seen conversions like this. I knew I was on to something big!</br></br>
                    SO, I gave the Ultimate Lead Magnet to a few friends of mine in the Affiliate Marketing space and WHAM, they got the same results!
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h2 class="fontcolor" style="margin: auto; margin-top: 50px;">That was the day I knew I had to pursue this Ultimate Lead Magnet system.</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <h3 class="fontcolor" style="margin: auto; margin-top: 50px;">
                        Next, I built and tested another one and then another one.</br></br>
                        I got a group of Beta testers involved and soon my dream of being able to provide this system to others was realized.</br></br>
                        Now, the Ultimate Lead Magnet system is ready for the marketing community to use.</br></br>
                        So what IS the Ultimate Lead Magnet system?</br></br>
                        Well, the Ultimate Lead Magnet system is a series of 3 special web sites that someone would normally pay money to access.</br></br>
                        The person who wants to give away access to these highly desirable web sites receives a special code that  allows them to set up a referral link and then give the web  site access away. When their prospects sign up the  name and email of those prospects is collected in their account and they can download the entire file of sign ups anytime they choose.</br></br>
                        Simply give away the link to the web site and collect your signups on demand!</br></br>
                        These web sites are PROVEN to convert!</br></br>
                        You will never need to build a Lead Magnet again!</br></br>
